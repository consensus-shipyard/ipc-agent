// Unfortunately by using `#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]` we cannot easily inspects events

// of interest then call a method on another behaviour. We can do this in another wrapper
// where we manually implement `NetworkBehaviour`, or the outer service where we drive the
// Swarm; there we are free to call any of the behaviours.
